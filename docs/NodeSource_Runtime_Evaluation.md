## Evaluation Framework

### Phase 1: Feature Discovery & Access
**Status**: üîÑ In Progress

**Issues Encountered**:
- SaaS dashboard lacks advanced features seen in demo

**Actions Required**:
- [ ] Verify correct N|Solid Console vs SaaS setup
- [ ] Check if demo features require different license/tier
- [ ] Contact NodeSource support for feature access
- [ ] Review documentation for advanced feature configuration

### Phase 2: Nx Process Monitoring Framework

#### Target Nx Processes for Analysis

**2.1 Build System Processes**
```bash
# TypeScript Compilation (40+ libraries)
yarn nx affected --targets=build --parallel=4

# GraphQL Code Generation
yarn nx run-many --all -t gen:graphql

# Webpack Bundling
yarn nx build admin-dashboard
```

**2.2 Testing & Validation Processes**
```bash
# Jest Test Runners (child processes)
yarn nx affected --targets=test --parallel=3

# ESLint Workers
yarn nx affected --targets=lint

# Full CI Pipeline Simulation
yarn prepr  # format:check + affected build/test
```

**2.3 Nx Daemon & Task Orchestration**
```bash
# Cold start analysis
yarn nx reset && yarn nx show projects

# Cache effectiveness
yarn nx affected --targets=build (warm vs cold)

# Task dependency resolution
yarn nx build backend --verbose
```

#### Performance Metrics to Capture

**Parent Process Metrics**:
- Nx daemon CPU/memory usage
- Task scheduling overhead
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Total execution time

**Child Process Metrics**:
- Worker spawn time and count
- Memory usage per worker
- Inter-process communication overhead
- Process lifecycle (creation ‚Üí completion)

**System-Level Metrics**:
- Peak memory consumption
- CPU utilization distribution
- File I/O patterns (cache, node_modules)
- Garbage collection frequency

## Performance Comparison

### Baseline (Native Node.js)
```bash
# Measure without N|Solid
time node node_modules/nx/bin/nx.js affected --targets=build
```

```bash
# Measure with N|Solid
time nsolid node_modules/nx/bin/nx.js affected --targets=build
```

**Performance Overhead Analysis**:
- [ ] Execution time difference: ____%
- [ ] Memory overhead: ____%
- [ ] CPU utilization impact: ____%
